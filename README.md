<H4>Background</H4> 
Currently 24 years of age, born and raised in Lagos Nigeria till the age of eight. I am one of five siblings, that includes two sisters and two brothers. I speak fluent English and also understand my native language of Yoruba, but speak it poorly.



<H4>Education</H4>
Graduated with my HSC from Allsaints Catholic Senior College in 2012. Where I studied Business Studies, PDHPE, Senior Science, General Maths and Standard English. I Attained my personal training qualification Certification 3 and 4 in 2017 from the Australian Institute of Fitness. Currently pursuing a Bachelors of Information Technology at RMIT. 



<H4>Industry Experience</H4>
I have under my belt a vast array of industry skills and experience. I’ve worked in a multitude of working environments, thus making me quite versatile. I have sales, customer servicing and insurance experience of over 7 years and looking to venture out into the field of IT. My most recent role was as a claims consultant for HCF in their head office, being in frequent communication with the IT department motivated me for the change.



<H4>Past time activities and interesting facts</H4>
My past time activities and hobbies are pretty much anything that requires physical exertion on my part. I am a fitness fanatic, but more specifically enjoy playing soccer and running. I’m also big on lifting weights. I’m a huge fan of the NBA and a diehard Houston Rockets fan.  

An interesting fact about myself is I am a self proclaimed “passive nerd” , I do a lot of nerdy activities that I am beginning to realise are really nerdy. For example I enjoy documenting everyday things happening in my life on google docs and creating little projects and challenges for myself. My most recent is a book reading challenge.
